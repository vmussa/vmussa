### Hello there!
My name is VÃ­tor Mussa. I'm a brazilian software developer and a data engineer :)

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:
  - [basedosdados.org](https://basedosdados.org)'s Python API and CLI tool and its infrastructure in general, using a lot of `CKAN`, `pytest`, `OOP`, `git`, `docker` and more.
  - [LABHD/UFBA](https://labhd.ufba.br)'s main research project's data pipeline, using PostgreSQL and Python with Pyrogram for massive Telegram data ingestion.
  - My master's dissertation research, using topic modeling to discover sociologically interesting hidden subjects in large social media text data.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:
  - Apache Spark / PySpark for big data processing
  - Kubernetes for running end-to-end big data pipelines (including Apache Spark)
